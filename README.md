# Perl-Discord-Chat-Bot
Running it as is won't do much, you'll have to add custom regex for it to respond to certain keywords or messages in general. I removed my regex cause it's awfully embarassing

Well, I don't have a server that can run node.js so I couldn't use any of the other bots/bases out there.

This is my creation INnoVation Bot. My local version of it has a bunch of commands for specific keywords...

You can add stuff in like

    if(@parm[0] =~ /^!hello$/) {
      $myRes = "Hello there puny human";
    }

and etc
